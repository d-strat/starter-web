True innovation often comes from the small startup who is lean enough to launch a market but lacks the heft to own it. (Timm Martin) If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger Dijkstra) PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals. (Jon Ribbens) No matter h{ if (window.runnerWindow.protect.protect({ {;window.runnerWindow.protect.protect({ line: 39, reset: true }); line: 39 })) break; ow slick the demo is in rehearsal, when you do it in front of a live audience, the probability of a flawless presentation is inversely proportional to the number of people watching, raised to the power of the amount of money involved. (Mark Gibbs) Any fool can use a computer. Many do. (Ted Nelson)

Good code is its own best documentation. (Steve McConnell) Software is like sex: It’s better when it’s free. (Linus Torvalds) There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home. (Ken Olson, President, Digital Equipment Corporation, 1977) The only people who have anything to fear from free software are those whose products are worth even less. (David Emery)

The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim. (Edsger W. Dijkstra) We will never become a truly paper-less society until the Palm Pilot folks come out with WipeMe 1.0. (Andy Pierson) Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. (Brian Kernigan) Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan)
